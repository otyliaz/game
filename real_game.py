#version 2.0:
#--made it print inventory when they type inv, prints this:
#What do you want to do? inv
#Your inventory: KNIFE

#--made it give some help when they type help; prints this:
#What do you want to do? help

#    Type "go [direction]" to go a direction.
#    Type "take" [item] to pick up an item.
#    Type "inv" to show your inventory.
#    Type "exit" to quit the game.

#checklist:
    
#make a thing like u can only go somewhere if u have something:
## "you can't go there, you need _____!"
#if pos is <=8, can't go to >8. if pos is >8, can go back.
#exit command

#make the map ðŸ’€
